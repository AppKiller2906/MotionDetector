# MotionDetector

Just a camera based motion detector!

I have tried to create a Motion Detector using opencv and numpy libraries. Bitwise operations on time frames of the Binary Image gives an output image if some motion is detected around the webcam. Most of the code was copied from other public github repositories. I hope it helps you! And don't forget to install all required python libraries.

I inspired myself of the [Motion-tracker]("https://github.com/mattwilliamson/Motion-Tracker/") by Matt Williamson for the operations and filters to apply on the image but all the rest is different.
